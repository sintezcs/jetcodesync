I need to implement a VS Code extension that will be Making HTTP request to a local endpoint to get the current open file and caret position from another IDE. The end point is... http://localhost:63344/api/filePosition And the simple response looks like this:
{
  "filePath": "/Users/aminakov/code/alisa-gpt/chat_client.py",
  "line": 16,
  "column": 24
}

The extension should make periodic requests to these endpoints, like every 5 seconds, and open the same file and move the caret to the same position that is taken from the API response. Please add deatiled loging to the stdout so we can verify it's working correctly.

I do not see JetCodeSync commands in the pallete

---

Is it possible to stop updating the cursor in open files when the editor is focused? like when I'm in the Visual Studio Code right now and when it loses focus then start updating it and actually process these events? Does it make sense?

---

Can we show the current status of the extension in the status bar? like when it's actively synchronizing the position and when it's paused. Also when it's active, let's poll the end point every second.

---

Can I create a panel where I can configure the extension? I should be able to provide the API URL for the JetBrains ID and also there should be a checkbox to enable and disable the sync. Also, there should be a status in the panel, is it enabled or not. Also, when we are polling and the endpoint is not available, It means that JetBrains ID is not running. In this case we should show some warning sign in the status bar and we should continue pulling anyway. Also, if the API is not available, it should be reflected in the extension panel.

---

Cool, it works. How can I pack this extension so I can install it locally to VS Code and cursor?

---

please do it

---

It looks like something is wrong with the state management because I installed the extension and it started with sync enabled even when I was focused in the editor. By default it should start in paused mode and it should only start syncing when it loses the focus.

---

Now we need to implement a functionality that will be listening to caret moves, to opening new file or to switching between open file tabs and expose it as an API endpoint using the same payload schema as it's currently used by the JetBrains endpoint.  The endpoint URL should be shown in the plugin panel.

---

Now the extension panel is not working, it's just empty.

Okay, I'd like to make it more user friendly in terms of choosing the sync destination and I wanted to auto-detect the possible IDEs to sync with. I      
  think we need to define a list of say 20 different ports that the extension can use. On start the extension should scan all of the ports to find      
  which of them are open and and query the new status endpoint. The status endpoint will return the ID name and the currently open project name.The         
  plugin should store the list of detected ports and corresponding IDE and project names, and fill the drop-down list in the extension panel with this      
  information. The plugin should skip the port exposed by the current IDE. By default, the first one should be selected and chosen for sync. The user       
  should be able to change the sync destination from the available ones in the plugin panel. The plugin itself should also expose the new status            
  endpoint that should return a JSON with two fields, the current IDE name and the currently open project name if there is any.
